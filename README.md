# Kayamba Tools

This repository is a collection of static data mainly of Niama (lingala for "animal") list which could be useful in the creation internet stuff. As a engineering and a web developer, I have come accross coping and pasting tones of data into MySql. For the last 4 years, have collected over 13,000 unique animal names. So, I have made available all my json file hopefully helping anyone out there from having to do this demanding type of work. I will keep it update as I progress.

I would like this to help with rapid prototyping of projects. For example: you might use `dogs.json` to start with, just to see if an idea you had was any good. Once you've built the project quickly around the nouns collection, you can then rip it out and replace it with a more complex or exhaustive data source.

I'm also hoping that this can be used as a teaching tool: maybe someone has three hours to teach how to make Twitter bots. That doesn't give the student much time to find/scrape/clean/parse interesting data. My hope is that students can be pointed to this project and they can pick and choose different interesting data sources to meld together for the creation of prototypes.

## What is Kayamba Tools?

 * Kayamba Tools is repository of JSON files. If you want to create an NPM repo or whatever based on this, be my guest, but this repository will remain a collection of data files that can be interpreted by any language that can parse JSON.
 * Kayamba Tools is a collection of _large_ files. It is meant to be an exhaustive source of animal names and other files: a list of resources should contain somewhere in the vicinity of 2000 items.
   * Some lists are not complete, futher research are suggested.

## List of Kayamba-Tools case studies

 * [animal-database-project](), an animal database website.
 * [kinid](), a Congolese Job Site

## I have some data, how do I submit?

We accept pull requests to this repository. Some guidelines:

 * BY SUBMITTING DATA AS A PULL REQUEST, YOU AGREE TO OUR APPLYING A [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) FREE CULTURE LICENSE TO THE DATA, MEANING THAT ANYONE CAN USE THE DATA FOR ANY REASON WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION IN PERPETUITY.
 * Please submit all data as JSON format in a file with a `.json` extension, and please [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/) your files before submitting. If you see a test failure notification in your PR after you submit, there's a problem with your JSON!
 * Keep individual files to about 1000 "things" maximum. Fewer than 1000 is fine, too.
 * If you'd like attribution, I'm happy to include your name in this Readme file. Just remember that nobody who uses this data is obligated to include attribution in their own projects.
